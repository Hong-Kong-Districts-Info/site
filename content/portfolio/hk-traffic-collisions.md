This is a data visualisation project on Hong Kong traffic collisions. 

Our objective is three-fold:

- (i) alert the public on the current severity of traffic collisions in Hong Kong, with particular dire implications for pedestrians and cyclists, 
- (ii) to draw attention to how street design has contributed to the current situation, and what systemic remedies should be made to enhance the safety of vulnerable road users.
- (iii) to provide journalists, district councillors, and government departments with insights and map-based data evidence to understand this issue
