### The App
The Shiny app is deployed onto shinyapps.io in the link below:

<a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block" href="https://hkdistricts-info.shinyapps.io/dashboard-hkdistrictcouncillors/" role="button">Shiny dashboard</a>

There is also a static site version of the district councillors individual pages here:

<a class="btn btn-secondary btn-lg btn-block" href="/dc/" role="button">Static Site version</a>

### GitHub Repository
The GitHub repo can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Hong-Kong-Districts-Info/dashboard-hkdistrictcouncillors). 

As part of the philosophy of the project, we have tried to adhere as closely as possible to the best practices in open-source app development. This includes:

- Version control (git)
- Dependency management (using the package {renv})
- Cookie use permission (a pop out dialogue to request user permission)

### Data sources
This app uses data from:
- Wikipedia
- Facebook pages from each District Councillor
- [Shapefiles of Hong Kong District Councils](https://accessinfo.hk/en/request/shapefileshp_for_2019_district_c)

Most of the data is put together as part of our other project {hkdatasets}, which collects public domain data about Hong Kong district councillors in an R package. Click [here](../../portfolio/hkdatasets/) to find out more.
