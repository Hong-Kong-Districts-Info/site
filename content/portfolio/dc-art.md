### Background

This project combines Hong Kong's district council icons with code to generate a series of 'District Ball' graphics that can be used for communications, publications, or plain simple humour.

We created a set of graphics for each of Hong Kong's 18 districts, which you will find scattered on our website as icons representing the respective councils. 

### hkdistrictballs R package

The [**hkdistrictballs**](https://github.com/Hong-Kong-Districts-Info/hkdistrictballs) R package allows you to generate custom district balls with your desired districts, captions, and facial expressions. 

This package is still now active development, but you can try it out with our development version on [GitHub](https://github.com/Hong-Kong-Districts-Info/hkdistrictballs). 

_More coming soon..._
